### Hi there I am Daria Knyazeva from Russia ðŸ‘‹

###My Artist account:

I transforme plasticine into Art, inspire people.

Plasticine painting is very unique, yet it is starting to gain popularity. I can call myself a pioneer, and receiving a painting from me will place you in avant-garde too. I paint with the tips of my fingers, sharing Love, Happiness and my Energy with you. I collect orders from all over the world, DM me on my Artist account for orders:
