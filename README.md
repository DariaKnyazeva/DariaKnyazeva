## Machine Learning and Data Science

I have gained certificates:

[Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/WTPALQVUXJ2H) (Imperial College London at Coursera)

[Applied Data Science with Python](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/D5ED4S7SRQSV) (Michigan University at Coursera)

[Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/api/legacyCertificates.v1/spark/statementOfAccomplishment/972224~34133/pdf) (Stanford course by Andrew Ng at Coursera)

I also have work experience in this area, I ran my own startup that provides services to innovative companies in Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning. ***DataTiding Agency*** helped to clean and normalize the collected data samples to prepare them for analysis and to be ready to feed to Machine Learning algorythms. It is said that *"tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way"*. DataTiding Agency structure your dataset to meet ***Coddâ€™s 3rd normal form***, that is each variable is a *column*, each observation is a *row*, each observational unit is a *table*.

We give you an IPython notebook (Jupyter), which you can run for cleaning your stuff as the new data is collected or new problems come to light. Up to 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning the dataset. We help you to focus on the interesting domain problem, not on the routine logistics of data.

## My Artist account

I transforme plasticine into Art, inspire people.

Plasticine painting is very unique, yet it is starting to gain popularity. I can call myself a pioneer, and receiving a painting from me will place you in avant-garde too. I paint with the tips of my fingers, sharing Love, Happiness and my Energy with you. I collect orders from all over the world, DM me on my Artist account for orders:
